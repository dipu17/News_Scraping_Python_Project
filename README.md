#News Scraper with Text-to-Speech

This Python project scrapes the latest news headlines from the Hindustan Times website based on the user's selected category (e.g., India, world, technology). It utilizes requests and BeautifulSoup to fetch and parse news headlines. The extracted headlines are then converted into speech using gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) and played using playsound. The script ensures a seamless user experience by automatically deleting the generated audio file after playback.

Key Features:
✅ User-input-based news category selection
✅ Web scraping using requests and BeautifulSoup
✅ Text-to-Speech conversion with gTTS
✅ Automatic audio playback and cleanup

This project is useful for those who prefer listening to news instead of reading.
